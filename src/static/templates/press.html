    <div class="part_1">For some people, meeting people after moving to a new place is easy. These people can balance work and friends seamlessly, never having to worry about what they’re doing Friday night. For everyone else, moving to a new city for your first real job is pretty terrifying. Finding people to party with when you feel like partying, and people to watch movies with when you feel like watching movies is easier said than done.

<div class="part_2">Since College, I’ve made new friends the following ways:
<ul class="press_list">
  <li>1. They’re a roommate.</li>
  <li>2. They work 10 feet away from me.</li>
  <li>3. I knew them through someone, or I knew them in the past.</li>
 </ul>
I guess #3 doesn’t count as “new friends”, but you get the point. Anyway, I eventually made do, and met a good group of people. However, I won’t soon forget the struggles I faced when I first moved to San Francisco. 

  <h2>I don't care, what's Frenvu? </h2>
  So when I heard about <a href="http://www.frenvu.com/">Frenvu</a>, I was pretty intrigued. They’re basically a free matching site for platonic relationships, essentially, “a site for making friends online”. You answer a few questions, like a few interests, and then are placed in a “crowd”, which is made up of people near you, who you’re supposed to match pretty well with. At first my crowd seemed kind of lame (a few people didn’t have profile pictures) but my next one, (you can find a new one every day) actually had people that seemed pretty cool, who also lived in SF.  
  <h2> Meet people outside your network </h2>
I talked to one guy,  a fellow Los Angeles Kings fan,  and ended up grabbing a beer with him to watch the season opener.  He worked as a developer down the street from me, but chances are I never would have met him on my own. Same goes for all the other people who I've met through the site so far.

<div class="part_3">
Aside from those features, <a href="http://www.frenvu.com/">Frenvu</a> feels like a pretty typical, albeit rough, social networking site. I’m not saying Frenvu will make you the most popular guy or girl in the city, especially since their user base seems small right now, but it’s pretty fun and something new. So if you’re into meeting new people, interested in making friends online, or you just haven’t been having any luck lately, check out Frenvu. It’s pretty cool.
